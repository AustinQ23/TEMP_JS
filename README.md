Programming should be a seamless translation of thought into logic, but too often, developers spend their time fighting runtime errors, overly complex type systems, and unintentional state mutations. We created TEMP_JS to solve these frustrations. TEMP_JS is built on the belief that a compiler should be your strictest mentor and your best friend. By forcing developers to be explicit about mutability, while intelligently inferring types behind the scenes, TEMP_JS catches logical bugs before the code ever runs. It combines the expressive syntax of dynamic scripting languages with a compiler that checks program correctness using an abstract syntax tree.

## Features

* **Type Inference:** Catch type errors at compile-time without writing a single type annotation. The compiler infers types from initializers and literals.
* **Immutable by Default:** Variables defined with `let` cannot be mutated. Opt-in to mutability by using `mut`.
* **AST Optimization:** Features an optimization phase that automatically performs constant folding and dead code elimination.
* **Clean Syntax:** Minimalist punctuation (no semicolons required) and unified array handling without sacrificing readability.
* **JavaScript Transpilation:** Compiles down to clean, optimized JavaScript (`.js`) ready to be executed in any modern JS environment or browser.

## Static, Safety, and Security Checks

The TEMP_JS compiler performs significant work during the semantic analysis phase to guarantee code safety:

1. **Undeclared Variable Checking:** Variables and functions must be declared in their lexical scope before they are used.
2. **Mutability Enforcement:** A compile-time error is immediately thrown if a reassignment is attempted on an immutable `let` variable.
3. **Inferred Type Checking:** All assignments, arithmetic operators, and relational operators verify type compatibility based on inferred types (e.g., attempting `3 + "hello"` will fail).
4. **Contextual Constraints:** `break` statements are strictly checked to ensure they only exist inside loops.
5. **Arity Matching:** Function calls are evaluated during the first pass to ensure the number of provided arguments perfectly matches the function's declared parameter count.
